// The singleton design pattern is used to create a single instance that may have some state that is shared across
// multiple resources in an application.
// There will only ever be a single instance of the singleton (hence the name)
// Examples may include a runtime and a logger
// Drawbacks include that the application may be harder to test due to different sections of the application relying on
// the singleton, it also introduces a sort of global state that may become hard to manage.
